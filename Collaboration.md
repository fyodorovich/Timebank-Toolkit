# Collaborating Online

> Applications running online, are also called services, software as a service (SaaS), or platforms. 
> All of these collaborative suites run online, so it does not matter which operating system you use
> They can be used from desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile

``TIP`` Collaborating online is easiest when everyone uses the same tools.

## The Back Story
Collaborating traditionally required a group of people to be in the same space. The infrastructure of the internet now provides that space. During the last ten years, online services have developed that allow groups of people to collaborate in a multitude of ways. Scrapbooking (Facebook), Diaries (Instagram, Twitter), and Blogs/Vlogs (WordPress, Youtube, Tik Tok) led the way in collaboration tools and shaped a lot of our thinking and behaviour. They were considered suitable for fun, non-essential, recreational activities. It was individual activity that occurred in a common space. In line with that attitude, business had been slow to engage (for many different reasons). 

These [communal online spaces](BroadcastCommunications.md) accustomed us to working within a group online and revealed the potential for aggregative work but in the tools weren't collaborative. When pandemic responses undertaken globally in 2020 forced workforces to stay home that attitude shifted. Keeping colleagues away from the shared spaces that they were accustomed to normalised the need for business to utilise online resources. The demand for online collaborative tools exploded. 

We'll look at two broad groups of tools: [office suites](#office) and [project management tools](#prm).

## Office Suites <a name="office"></a>
Collaboration tools suitable for businesses of all sizes, across all sectors, are readily available. Driven by the huge influx of income and demand during the last two years, the range, quality, and functionality of these services has improved enormously. 

We look at suites of collaboration tools from [three service providers: Google, Microsoft, and Zoho](OfficeSuites.md).  

``TIP`` _All of these providers offer a free account to individuals. Highly recommended._  
``TRAP`` _Having four or five individual accounts is not the same as having a team account_

### Privacy and Data Privacy

Companies have very odd attitudes to privacy. It is strongly influenced by the boggling amounts of money that can be made from information. 
 - [Microsoft Data Privacy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/enterprise/privacy-personal-data)   
	The privacy policy of Microsoft is fairly clear. It uses and shares your meta-data with third parties.
- [Zoho Data Privacy](https://www.zoho.com/privacy-commitment.html)    
	Zoho has better privacy policies than Google or Microsoft. 
- [Google Data Privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)  
 	Google has a privacy statement, probably because there is a legal requirement to do so. Its entire business model is based on selling and reselling data obtained from us.


#### Data Privacy
Most companies have a "you created it you own it" attitude to the content you bring or generate on the platform. They are very good at preserving that data and ensuring that it is secure. 

>Facebook, now Meta, and [all of its companies](https://inspirationfeed.com/what-companies-does-facebook-own/), say that anything that you post or create on their platforms belongs to them. You agreed with that when you first set up your account. 

#### Metadata
Things get weird when we enter the grey area called *meta-data.* Most companies insist that the meta-data belongs to them. They don't need to ask your permission to make use of a lot of information _about you_. 

The European Union introduced the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and it means that many companies are now more open about what they do with meta-data and other data.
