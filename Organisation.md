## Cloud Backup, Cloud Storage, and  File Sharing  <a name="differences"></a>

### What is the difference between Cloud Backup, Cloud Storage, and  File Sharing?  

**Cloud Storage** is the cloud version of your hard drive. This is where you'd place all the files that you want to work on and share with others. It is an external hard drive that doesn't sit on your desk and is internet accessible. These services also facilitate **File Sharing**. There is a big overlap between cloud storage and file sharing. 

**Cloud Backups** are backup services designed to store entire hard drives. They are designed for invisible, behind-the-scenes, continuous backup of the data on your hard-drive. *Cloud backup services are not designed for file sharing*. These services aren't designed for day-to-day access. You access these backups if you need to retrieve and replace a lost or damaged document, otherwise you never look at them. Like insurance, it's best if you don't ever need to use it.

Dedicated **File Sharing services** tend to be for storage and transfer of documents rather than for storing active documents that you are interacting with. Transferring small files by email or messaging is easy but larger files can gum up the works. Very large files will be rejected by email and message servers. When that happens a dedicated file sharing service is invaluable. You can share documents that are located in cloud storage but for a variety of reasons (including security), you may not want to do that. You may just want to send the file as a one-off. 


``TIP`` 
> Documents that are created in the cloud are continually being backed up. 

If you are using a [collaborative productivity suite](Collaboration.md) your documents will be online and backed up automatically. These companies store your documents on systems that are always accessible. Any documents that you create using these services are going to be stored in the cloud, i.e., **cloud storage**. You can typically share these, directly or via download links, i.e., **file sharing**. In addition, there are options for recovering deleted documents, for a few months after they were deleted, i.e., **cloud backup**. In short, the online office tools provides all three services.

### Cloud Backup    <a name="backup"></a>

``TIP`` 
> If you are using a cloud based productivity suite, all of those documents are already stored and backed up. 


#### Using the Built-in Extras provided with your Operating System
All of the big players are providing a small amount cloud storage as a free service for users of their hardware. They also offer increased storage volumes for an extra fee. These backup services are tightly integrated with the operating system and the software. 

``PRO`` It's a great user experience  
``CON`` Being so tightly tied into one system may restrict you when you collaborate

#### Dedicated Backup Services
These services provide continuous backup of your computer, except for the operating system. If you are serious about backups, and want comprehensive backup security these services are excellent value.

### File Transfer <a name="sharing"></a>
These file transfer/sharing companies allow you to store files online. However, their fees for storage tend to be higher than companies which describe themselves as cloud storage. 

Both of the services we list below allow ad-hoc file transfers for free. The free transfers have a ceiling on the maximum file size but those limits are generous enough for most needs.
