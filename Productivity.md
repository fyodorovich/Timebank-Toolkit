## Collaboration with your Team <a name="collaboration"></a>

Collaborating with a distributed team requires good [communications software](#communications), effective [project management software](#management), and an [appropriate swag of tools for words, numbers](#office) and [images](#avcontent) 


### Office Suites <a name="office"></a>

The means for working online exploded recently. There are so many tools that provide the means to share documents that we  have a special page to discuss [Collaboration for Office groups, remote teams, and ad-hoc groups](Collaboration.md).

There is a lot of cross-over with [communications software](#com	munications). In the three office suites that we focus on, every one of them includes video conferencing and messaging tools. 


### Project Management Tools <a name="management"></a>

``TIP``
>Dedicated project management tools will reduce the workload involved in managing the job processes and give you more time to bring your imagination and creativity to the task. 

There is an enormous amount of cross-over between all of the software services we are presenting. The office suites include tools for project management (PM). The PM services include tools that are suitable for your office work. The difference lies in the extent of integration between all the different tools that you would use. There will still be a need for the content creation tools that an office suite provides, for example, general word processing,  number crunching, and audio-visuals. 


``TIP`` 
>All of these PMs will enable workflow automations and integrations with third-party tools

Dedicated PM tools integrate your communications with your calendars, charts, timelines, and so on. The integration reduces the amount of in-between work that you would otherwise have to do, such as flipping between spreadsheets and calendar, then flipping out to your email or messages to post to a group. This has two immediate benefits: first and most importantly, *things don't fall through the gaps*. The next thing to-do becomes a button press, not a five or ten minute digression that breaks your flow. We've just alluded to the second thing. *You will save a lot of time* because so much of the incidental elements of the work occurs within the PM tool. You are not switching between tools. And because everything is in the PM tool, it's able to make the connections that ease your workload. 

``PROS``  
>Tightly integrated planning, execution, and communications 


``CON`` 
>If you aren't familiar with the way they work, it can require some effort, and a change in thinking, and behaviour, to get the full benefits from a PM tool.


#### A few of the best, in alphabetical order

#### Resources
Good resource libraries make it easy to find images to convey the appropriate message. There are a lot of different resources, you have plenty of choice. 

``TIP`` 
>Always check the conditions for use. Free to use does not mean copyright free. 

While they offer free use of their images, most creators retain the copyright over the work. The resource libraries usually do their best to support that by offering a "click-to-copy" dialog that contains the authors name and the website location. You simply paste that text into the web site or include it wherever you use the image. This makes attribution easy.
