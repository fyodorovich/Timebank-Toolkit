# About the Toolkit

## Foundations
The toolkit has been built using markdown formatted text files in a Github repository. 

Our rationale for choosing markdown format is that it is widely used by many different types of software, and fairly easy to learn or imitate. 

We chose to use a public github repository to host the toolkit. Doing so provided us with the ability to publish our work on the web immediately
and we have the confidence that the work will continue to be hosted and remain available for people to use. 

In addition, a Github repo had a lot of other advantages. 

* It allows us collaborate remotely
* It provides project management tools
* It provides version control, great for walking back to an earlier edit
* and an issues tracker
* as well as many other tools

## Behaviours

The toolkit is simply a web site and you can use it by bouncing around from link to link. 

We have intended the toolkit to be an adjunct to the [CW3 Documentation](http://wiki.timebanks.org/wiki).
We provide links to the documentation throughout the toolkit. 

We also provide links to other resources. Many of the resources are web sites and we cannot guarantee that the links we provide will remain valid. 
In fact, the resources we have linked may go the way of the Dodo too. If you see that happening please let us know so that we can update the toolkit.

Throughout the text we try to bring items to your attention. You'll see things such as 

``TIP`` this is a handy piece of information   
``TRAP`` watch out, don't get caught   
``CRAP`` something's not right and it's out of your control   
``GOTCHA`` pay attention to avoid surprises    
``NOTICE`` ``WARNING`` and ``ALERT`` these are things you should know    
``Pros`` and ``Cons`` will give you sense of what the costs and benefits are   

## Contributing

There are several ways to contribute. The simplest is to raise an issue on the repository. We'll be notified and have a look at your issue. 
We'll make changes in accordance with your advice or we'll start a discussion with you about it.  

If you feel like you want to make a larger contribution to the toolkit you can fork the repo. 
That will provide you with a full working copy. 
Make the changes or additions that you want to see included in the Toolkit and then send a pull request. We'll be able to look at your contributions and then either accept them in full or in part. 

The beauty of having the toolkit under version control is that our combined efforts can allow the toolkit to grow, becomming better and more useful.
