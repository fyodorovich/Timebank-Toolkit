# Timebank Toolkit: a working guide for Timebank Coordinators 

_Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart._

## Who is this toolkit for?

We aim to benefit:
- the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of [Aotearoa / New Zealand’s timebanks](TimebanksANZ.md)
- new or old, big or small, rural or urban
- the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours

## Introduction
During the second half of 2021 [Wellington Timebank](https://wellingtonsouth.timebanks.org) funded a [research project](http://www.newtowncommunity.org.nz/timebank-toolkit) which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators. The broad purpose of the research was to document [our collective experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6Fky5CK_OfiQzhPGYmj78ezXj6Ov03WlkWU3oR77gE/edit#slide=id.p) and to [use the findings](Findings.md)  to provide administrators with this toolkit.

After talking with numerous timebank staff and coordinators, we want to share with you what we found to be **the best tools, tech, and processes you can use to help your timebank flourish (and share it onwards!)**

## Setting up a Timebank

Section one: [Setting up a Timebank](section_01.md)

This section looks at everything needed in setting up a timebank. How do you form a core group? How do you secure funding for your group? How do you build your community? While we mostly point to other's resources (such as, ["How to Build a Timebank"](https://timeexchange.co.nz/images/Resources/Startup/How-to-Build-a-TimeBank.pdf)) to respond to these questions, this toolkit includes a wealth of knowledge we've gathered about **choosing a platform for Timebanking, running activities, and considerations for managing a website.**

## Membership and Administration

Section two: [Membership and Administration](section_02.md)

This section helps you with the nuts and bolts of things like **sign-up, membership administration, and onboarding.** Getting people to join your Timebank and managing the processes involved is not as simple as it appears. It can be time-consuming, especially when you are assisting several people at once. It will cover **reference checks, process management, police checks, and orientation sessions.**
 

## Running a Timebank 

Section three: [Running a Timebank](section_03.md)

This section deals with communications, networking, and engagement. Find help with **newsletters, social media engagement, content creation, and what apps and software to use**; you'll also find tips and tools regarding monthly meetings and organisation guidelines.
